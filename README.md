# Summer Hack Project \#Code2040

## Setup Guide

### Probably optional but you'll need this stuff if you ever want to create your own react-native app
- Install node/npm 
- Install react native by using `npm install -g create-react-native-app`

### You need these to be installed before running the app
- Install watchman by using `brew update && brew install watchman`
- Install fb watchman by using `npm install fb-watchman`

### Dev Setup
- Clone this repo (SSH Prefered)
- Run `npm install` in the dir.
- You can then go ahead and try doing `npm start`. If this doesn't work, try `npm audit fix`. This should fix any dependency issues.

Feel free to change / add the readme if you come across anything that work / didn't work for you.
